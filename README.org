#+TITLE: .emacs.d config files

* 1. General overview

This is a pretty basic emacs config, running evil mode. Bindings are seperated into 'SPC' for modifying inside a file and ',' for anything more global.
Note that evil bindings do not work in modes like dired, and not all emacs bindings have an evil counterpart. (Help is still C-h for example)

* 2. Install

  - Clone into ~/
    
* 3. Core Packages

The key packages for this config include
 
  - Evil
  - Company
