#+TITLE: .emacs.d config files

* 1. General overview

This is a pretty basic emacs config, running evil mode. Bindings are seperated into 'SPC' for modifying inside a file and ',' for anything more global.

Note that evil bindings do not work in modes like dired, and not all emacs bindings have an evil counterpart. (Help is still C-h for example)

When inside magit, "\\" will toggle text mode, which will let you use evil bindings.
